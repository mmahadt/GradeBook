# GradeBook
A Grade book using Hibernate and Spring

#Implementation details and architecture
First of all I added the password of mySQL in the hibernate.cfg.xml file.

Then I created a db in mySQL called gradebook. The name was same as defined by the given code.

After that I had to udate the dependencies for hibernate and mysql in pom.xml fle so that the code
started to run.

Then I made all the business Object (BO's) classes for grades, teachers etc.

Then we make all the the methods of update and add in all the BOs
